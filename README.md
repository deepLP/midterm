I made this project by using javascript with html structure. 
This React application displays a list of cars and their details, allowing users to select a car from the menu to view more information. It's built with React and demonstrates the use of components, state, props, and basic event handling.


## Key Features

- Displays a list of cars.
- Clickable car names to view detailed information.
- Responsive design for various screen sizes.
